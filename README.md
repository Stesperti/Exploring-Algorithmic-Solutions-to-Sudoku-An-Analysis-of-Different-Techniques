This jupyter notebook investigates the application of three distinct algorithms:
Backtracking, Dancing Links, and Simulated Annealing,
in solving Sudoku puzzles. It provides a detailed
examination of each algorithm’s Python implementation,
computational cost, and effectiveness. Through comparative
analysis and simulation, the project delves into these approaches’
strengths and weaknesses. Find the report at the following  [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dQdgMD8Kik5Eo1dNN1LyxeUzpesnXdHA/view?usp=sharing)
