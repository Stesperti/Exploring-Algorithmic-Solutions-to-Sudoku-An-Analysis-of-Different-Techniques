This jupyter notebook investigates the application of three distinct algorithms:
Backtracking, Dancing Links, and Simulated Annealing,
in solving Sudoku puzzles. It provides a detailed
examination of each algorithm’s Python implementation,
computational cost, and effectiveness. Through comparative
analysis and simulation, the project delves into these approaches’
strengths and weaknesses.
